TimeStamp Micro-Service
=========================

This is a project from [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)'s back end certification.


How it works
------------
Send a post request to https://lincbartfcctimestamp.glitch.me/ and add either a Unix time stamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016) after the backslash and the service will return a JSON object with both the Unix timestamp and natural language for your input.
